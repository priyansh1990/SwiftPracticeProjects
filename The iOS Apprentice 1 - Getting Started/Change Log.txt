The iOS Apprentice 1: Getting Started

Version 3.1 (17 October 2014)
=============================

- Updated for Xcode 6.1 and iOS 8.1.

- Loading the "SliderTrackLeft" and "SliderTrackRight" images needs "if let" 
  because UIImage(named) is now a failable initializer. It may return nil if
  the image could not be loaded.

- The instructions for editing "Bundle display name" in Info.plist were incorrect.


Version 3.0 (17 September 2014)
===============================

First release of the Third Edition.
